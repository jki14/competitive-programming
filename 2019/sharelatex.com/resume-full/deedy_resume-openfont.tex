% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\begin{tightemize}
\item Accelerate normalized 2048-dimension 32-bit float vector nearest neighbor searching by 50 times though converting the problem to cosine similarity with linear algebra optimization and automatic vectorization.
\item Improve the efficiency of a set of the geometric request in the computer visual computing processes significantly with some computational geometry techniques.

\location{Prepare and implement the distributed high-dimensional vector archiving and approximate k-Nearest Neighbors searching system working for computer vision computing. Research and perform the superficial image scene indexing algorithm with Machine Learning techniques. Create the complex branching game logic engine for the platform. Develop the RESTful Web Service for the mobile applications.}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Independently prepare and implement WLANN (Wonderland Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors). It works more than 30\% faster than \textbf{\href{http://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/flann}{FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors)}} with 128-dimensional 8-bit unsigned integer vectors. On the other hand, WLANN is further optimized for parallel query and provides distributed computing support.
\item Independently research and perform a superficial image scene indexing algorithm based on \textbf{\href{https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/courses/AP06/Papers/csurka-eccv-04.pdf}{Visual Categorization with Bags of Keypoints}} technique. It provides an accuracy of up to 93\% of the landmark scene superficial indexing for the product.
\item Both two modules described above has remarkable stability, these modules had been working for more than one year continuously with no accident and visible memory leaks.
